# Chat Application using React and Firebase

This is a simple chat application built using React and Firebase. It uses the Firebase Realtime Database to store messages and the Firebase Authentication to authenticate users. The application uses Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the application and React Router to handle routing.

Firebase Hosting is used to deploy the application. Firebase Cloud Functions are used to create a serverless API to trigger notifications when a new message is added to the database.
